8.	
e. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: 
-	(i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (“Attribution Parties”) in Licensor’s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; 
-	(ii) the title of the Work if supplied; 
-	(iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, 
-	(iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., “French translation of the Work by Original Author,” or “Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author”); and
-	(v)  to the extent reasonably practicable, the cryptographic SHA-512 hash of this license
The credit required by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of an Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
f. For the avoidance of doubt:
i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,
iii.Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b).
g. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author’s honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author’s honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

h. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all provenance/lifecycle information (information related to how the Work was produced and the chain of adaptations), and provide the particulars describe below, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: 
-	The production of the original Work
-	Original Authorship
-	Contributors and their roles
-	Labor involved 
-	Costs of production
-	Governance of the production
-	Any profits of the production
-	The production of any prior Adaptations of the Work of which You are using
-	(i) the way in which the Work was created;
-	(ii) the labor involved;
-	(iii) the profits taken; and
-	(iv) the governance of the production


Not only is CC-licensed work not common property, unlike movements that reject copyright in favour of the public domain, common- or non-ownership, it also says nothing about the ways in which the creative work was brought into being: the labour involved, the profits taken and the governance of such efforts.


5. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMER
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.

6. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
8. MISCELLANEOUS
a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here.

These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

9. Commons Resources

a.	The Licensor must deposit a document evincing the existence of the Work (i.e., proof of existence) with a commons resource, such as an open access repository or database, or a transparent database. However, the Work itself need not be accessible in a commons resource. A proof-of-existence that may satisfy this requirement is a cryptographically-secure timestamp or a cryptographic hash of the Work. The Licensor must complete this requirement before or on the date the Licensor licenses the Work under this License. The Licensor must include relevant keywords, if possible, when depsoiting the proof of existence.
b.	The Licensee must deposit a document evincing the existence of any and all  Adaptations of the Work (i.e., proof of existence) with a commons resource, such as an open access repository or database, or a transparent database. However, the Adaptation itself need not be accessible in a commons resource. A proof-of-existence that may satisfy this requirement is a cryptographically-secure timestamp or a cryptographic hash of any and all Adaptations. The Licensee must complete this requirement within fourteen (14) days after creating an Adaptation of the Work under this License, for each and every Adaptation of the Work. The Licensee must include relevant keywords, if possible, when depsoiting the proof of existence.
c.	

10. Payments
a. All payments by the Licensee to the Licensor must conform with the following requreimetns:

-	The units of value (i.e., money or currency) constituing the payment must be a cryptocurrency.
-	The payment must be made to the Licensor’s public address on a blockchain.
-	The payment must be made by December 31st of every year, including the year this License is executed. 

11. Summary

The License is meant to require the licensor to keep their Works in the commons or to be stewarded for a greater purposes if the Work becomes releid upon by many people or the relevant community, and if the licensee is a capitalist commericla entiy, they must apply the Harberger Tax method to ensure that the Licensor recieves some remuneration from the capitalist commerical enitty for the use of the work, and to incentivize captialsit commericl entities to not abuse the commons. 

The License also requires the Lciensor to include provenance information (i.e., metadata) about the Work to make it easer to track the Work and know how it was developed, i.e., tracking the lifecyle (and a bit of value accounting) of the Work as it is created and adapted (need mention in Reps nd Waranties; ad maybe include Indemnity).

To track this license over the web, you can use the JSON-LD standard. 

Question? Should this license be interptreed Liberally?
