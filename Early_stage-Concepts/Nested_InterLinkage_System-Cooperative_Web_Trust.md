# **Introduction**

For our Ledgerback Digital Commons Research Cooperative (LDCRC) Roadmap for 2020 - 21, we have decided to discuss our specific end-goals in individual posts, centered on the development of certain projects and research objectives, throughout April and May.

In this post, we will discuss the Nested Inter-Linkage Systems (NILS) document and our goals for the project.

# About

The Nested Inter-Linkage Systems (NILS) document is derived from Charles Adjovu and Jack Smye’s thoughts on the future of digital organizations, initially discussed in our recently rejected submission to Nesta’s Decentralized Future Prize competition, which may be found _**[here](https://thinklusive.pubpub.org/pub/ir8jpgmu)**_ or below:

Our major end goal for this document is to finalize and expand our thoughts on the above post. Additionally, to see if the document resonates with the thoughts and perspectives of other researchers and members in the Platform Cooperativism, P2P, Digital Commons and Web3 spaces.

# Basic Description

In the document, we plan to go over three areas in the NILS document:

1.  Inter-Linkages
    
2.  System Design
    
3.  Regenerative Economic Models
    

## Inter-Linkages

Our primary focus on nested inter-linkages will be on how the digitalization of organizations, individuals, representatives, institutions, and markets (collectively _digital entities_), the rise of Cyber-Physical systems, and the growth the data economy, will lead to a greater inter-connectedness than has ever been seen before, which will require us to re-think how we build and grow our relationships.

The main focus on inter-linkages is two-fold. First, how the relationships between digital individuals will change with respect to other digital entities and data sovereignty. Second, how digital organizations will become more integrated with other digital entities, especially in regards to the development of a meta-organization structure.

### System Design

The design for the Inter-linked Digital Entity System is primarily a system of platforms and networks of inter-linkages (i.e., nested inter-linkages), generally centered on the digital individual.

In this design, we can see two base inter-linkages being developed on a network or platform.

First, a base inter-linkage developed through:

-   Digital Individuals,
    
-   Digital Representative, and
    
-   Other digital entities.
    

In this base inter-linkage, digital individuals will have ownership and control of their digital identities (e.g., self-sovereign identities or decentralized identities) and personal information, and share this information either directly with other digital entities for limited purposes (on a consent basis), or share their information with a digital representative, that represents their and other similarly situated individuals interests (e.g., a collective or mutual), and acts similarly to a gate (that presents separation between the individual and the greater network), which will then interact with other digital entities on the digital individual’s behalf.

Second, a base inter-linkage developed through:

-   digital organizations,
    
-   digital markets, and
    
-   digital institutions
    

through a meta-organization structure, wherein the three above entities will connect together in a non-hierarchical manner in pursuit of a common mission or principles and values (e.g., securing the network or platform; or commons management).

More likely than not, these inter-linkages will not be exclusive to one network or platform, but rather will be developed on many different platforms and networks, employing many different technologies and standards.

The system will then be a collection platforms and networks where these inter-linkages exist (i.e., a collection of nested inter-linkages).

## Regenerative Economic Models

Though we did not touch upon this topic in our submission, we also plan to consider what regenerative economic models could be developed and/or become feasible in this system.
