## Web Science Education

To ensure the Web serves future generations, the WST promotes and supports the development of Web Science curricula at all relevant educational levels around the world.

**Web Science Education**

Education is of paramount importance to the Trust and we look to assist in the definition of curricula at all levels, provide support and backing of summer schools across all our Labs. Ultimately to ensure that our students and members have the right skills and tools to approach this complex task of engagement with the complex socio-technical interactions on the Web.
